                This site is about programming. So, what is programming?
                The term <i>programming</i> means to create (or develop)
                software, which is also called a program. This site teaches you
                how to create programs by using the Java <i>programming language</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>Java is a a powerful and versatile programming language for developing software
                running on mobile devices, desktop computers, and servers.</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                Java syntax is defined in the Java language specification, and the Java library is
                defined in the Java API. The JDK is the software for developing and running Java
                programs. An IDE is an integrated development environment for rapidly developing
                programs. The Java language specification is a technical definition of the Java programming
                language's syntax and semantics. You can find the complete Java language specification at
                <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                You save a Java program in a .java file and compile it into a .class file. The .class file
                is executed by the Java Virtual Machine. The Java language is a high-level language, but Java bytecode is a low-level
                language. The bytecode is similar to machine instructions but is architecture neutral and can
                run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

            <p>
                The focus of this chapter is to introduce mathematical functions, characters, string
                objects, and use them to develop programs.
                Java provides many useful methods in the Math class for performing common mathematical
                functions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Besides characters and strings, in java are six other data types(numeric):
                <ul>
                    <li>Byte</li>
                    <li>Short</li>
                    <li>Integer</li>
                    <li>Long</li>
                    <li>Float(Decimal number)</li>
                    <li>Double(Decimal number)</li>        
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                An if statement is a construct that enables a program to specify alternative paths of execution
            </p>
                The preceding program displays a message such as “6 + 2 = 7 is false.” If you wish the
                message to be “6 + 2 = 7 is incorrect,” you have to use a selection statement to make this
                minor change.
                Java has several types of selection statements: one-way if statements, two-way if-else
                statements, nested if statements, multi-way if-else statements, switch statements, and
                conditional expressions.
                A one-way if statement executes an action if and only if the condition is true. The syntax
                for a one-way if statement is:
                <br>
                <code><br>
                    if (boolean-expression) {<br>
                        statement(s);<br>
                        }<br>
                </code><br>
            <p>
                A character data type represents a single character. In addition to processing numeric values, you can process characters in Java. The character
                data type, char, is used to represent a single character. A character literal is enclosed in single
                quotation marks. 
                
                <br>
                Consider the following code: <code><br>
                    char letter = 'A';<br>
                    char numChar = '4';<br>
                </code><br>
                <i>A string is a sequence of characters</i>

                The char type represents only one character. To represent a string of characters, use the data
                type called String. For example, the following code declares message to be a string with
                the value "Welcome to Java".
                <br>
                <code><br>
                    String message = "Welcome to Java";<br>
                </code><br>

                The focus of this chapter is on learning elementary programming techniques to solve
                problems.<br>
                Writing a program involves designing a strategy for solving the problem and then
                using a programming language to implement that strategy.<br>
                Let's first consider the simple problem of computing the area of a circle. How do we write a
                program for solving this problem?<br>
                Writing a program involves designing algorithms and translating algorithms into programming
                instructions, or code. An algorithm describes how a problem is solved by listing
                the actions that need to be taken and the order of their execution. Algorithms can help the
                programmer plan a program before writing it in a programming language. Algorithms can be
                described in natural languages or in pseudocode (natural language mixed with some programming
                code). The algorithm for calculating the area of a circle can be described as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Read in the circle's radius.</li>
                    <li>
                        Compute the area using the following formula:
                            <pre>   area = radius * radius * p</pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Display the result.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                A loop can be used to tell a program to execute statements repeatedly.

            <p>
                Suppose that you need to display a string (e.g., Welcome to Java!) a hundred times. It
                would be tedious to have to write the following statement a hundred times:
                <pre>   
                        System.out.println('Welcome to Java!');
                        System.out.println('Welcome to Java!');
                        System.out.println('Welcome to Java!');
                                        .
                                        .
                                    100 times
                                        .
                        System.out.println('Welcome to Java!');
                </pre>
                Java provides a powerful construct called a loop that controls how many times an operation
                or a sequence of operations is performed in succession. <br> Using a loop statement, you simply
                tell the computer to display a string a hundred times without having to code the print statement
                a hundred times, as follows:
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        int count = 0;
                        while (count < 100) {
                            System.out.println("Welcome to Java!");
                            count++;
                        }
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </p>

        <div class="methods">
            <p>
                Methods can be used to define reusable code and organize and simplify coding.<br>
                Suppose that you need to find the sum of integers from 1 to 10, from 20 to 37, and from 35
                to 49, respectively. <br> You may write the code as follows:
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        1   int sum = 0;
                        2   for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++)
                        3       sum += i;
                        4   System.out.println("Sum from 1 to 10 is " + sum);
                        5   
                        6   sum = 0;
                        7   for (int i = 20; i <= 37; i++)
                        8       sum += i;
                        9   System.out.println("Sum from 20 to 37 is " + sum);
                        10  
                        11  sum = 0;    
                        12  for (int i = 35; i <= 49; i++)
                        13      sum += i;
                        14  System.out.println("Sum from 35 to 49 is " + sum);
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                You may have observed that computing these sums from 1 to 10, from 20 to 37, and from
                35 to 49 are very similar except that the starting and ending integers are different.<br>Wouldn't
                it be nice if we could write the common code once and reuse it? We can do so by defining a
                method and invoking it. <br>
                The preceding code can be simplified as follows:
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        1 public static int sum(int i1, int i2) {
                        2       int result = 0;
                        3       for (int i = i1; i <= i2; i++)
                        4       result += i;
                        5
                        6       return result;
                        7 }
                        8
                        9 public static void main(String[] args) {
                        10      System.out.println("Sum from 1 to 10 is " + sum(1, 10));
                        11      System.out.println("Sum from 20 to 37 is " + sum(20, 37));
                        12      System.out.println("Sum from 35 to 49 is " + sum(35, 49));
                        13 }

                A single array variable can reference a large collection of data.
                <br>
                Once an array is created, its size is fixed. An array reference variable is used to
                access the elements in an array using an index.
            </p>
            <p>
                To use an array in a program, you must declare a variable to reference the array and specify
                the array's element type.<br>Here is the syntax for declaring an array variable:
